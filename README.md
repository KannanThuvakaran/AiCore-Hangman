## Description

Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/KannanThuvakaran/AiCore-Hangman.git

2. Ensure you have Python installed. Compatible with Python 3.

## Usage

- The game will randomly select a word from a predefined list of words.
- You have a limited number of lives (default is 5) to guess the word.
- Enter a single letter when prompted.
- If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed, and you'll be one step closer to winning.
- If the letter is not in the word, you'll lose a life.
- Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word or run out of lives.
